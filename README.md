# Cura profiles for (my) Anycubic Mega Pro 3D printer

In this repo I collect and publish the profiles I created for my Anycubic Mega Pro 3D printer.

## ABS
I found out that placing a garbage bag over the printer to prevent air movement and create a stable thermal environment is enough to successfully print ABS with my old and worn-out printer.
